print(" Welcome to the Python Review Activity!")
print("You’ll review variables, strings, numbers, and print formatting.\n")

# Step 1: Create Variables
# TODO: Replace the values below with your own info
first_name = "Xavier"
age = 16
favorite_color = "Blue"
favorite_number = 12

#  Step 2: Practice String Operations
# 1. Print your name in uppercase
print(first_name.upper())

# 2. Print how many letters are in your name
print(len(first_name))

# 3. Combine your name and favorite color into one message
print("My first name is" , (first_name), " and my favorite color is " , (favorite_color))

#  Step 3: Math Practice
# Use arithmetic operators with your favorite number
x = 5
print(f"{x + favorite_number}")

#  Step 4: User Input Practice
# Ask the user two questions and combine answers




# ⚙️ Step 5: Final Challenge (combine it all)
# Use math and strings together
