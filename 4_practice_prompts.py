###########################String Practice##################################
#syntax is the way we write code
# print("Hello World")
# name = "John"     
#in other languages, this is different
# in javascript for example, you define
#variables with let or const or var
#in python, you just give your variables a
#name and then define it with a value


#challenge
# find a summary of the movie blue beetle online and create a 
# variable called blue_beetle_summary and print it it out to the screen

# print the length of the summary
# upper case the entire summary
# print the summary
# print the summary in lowercase
# replace the word blue with red
# print the summary
# string index the word beetle and print it out
# print the last word of the summary
# print the summary in reverse

# Ask the user to enter their name.

# Input Practice #1
